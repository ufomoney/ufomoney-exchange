## Accessing the Mooniswap Interface
To access the Mooniswap Interface, use an IPFS gateway link from the
[latest release](https://github.com/CryptoManiacsZone/mooniswap-interface/releases/latest), 
or visit [mooniswap.exchange](https://mooniswap.exchange/).


## Development

### Install Dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

### Run

```bash
yarn start
```

### Configuring the environment (optional)

To have the interface default to a different network when a wallet is not connected:

1. Make a copy of `.env` named `.env.local`
2. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_ID` to `"{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}"`
3. Change `REACT_APP_NETWORK_URL` to e.g. `"https://{YOUR_NETWORK_ID}.infura.io/v3/{YOUR_INFURA_KEY}"` 

Note that the interface only works on mainent where all contracts are deployed.
The interface will not work on other networks.
